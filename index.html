                <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;">Theoretical expertise meets hands-on learning as seniors prepare for real-world engineering. <br><br> A requirement for graduation, student teams take on year-long capstone projects, putting their problem-solving skills to the test and collaborating to take an idea from concept to design to prototype. On the second Thursday in May, teams present their work to an audience of industry experts, faculty advisors, students, family, and friends of the School of Engineering at the annual Senior Design Conferenceâ€”a highlight of our academic year. All are welcome to watch the student presentations!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;">For our final project, we chose to focus on how seniors could find team members to do a senior design project with and how industry partners could send project ideas to SCU for students to work on. On the team members side we wanted students to be able to see a little bio about each student and easily send them an email to collaborate. Similarly on the industry side, we wanted students to be able to see a variety of projects. <br><br> To accomplish both of these tasks we used PHP to keep track of storing the project ideas that are submitted and the students looking for team members. Along with PHP, we used JavaScript to show users what they submitted and for form validation.</p>
